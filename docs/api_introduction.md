> Before you begin
Much of what you will see on this page is based on the API documentation webinar I presented in July 2018 on the Information Developers Foundation (IDF) platform. The Youtube link to the video is here if you'd like to watch the video instead. I'd recommend you to watch the video and then come back here for further reading. 

## What is API documentation?

API document is a technical writing deliverable that contains information about API functionality, describes API endpoints, parameters, provides samples of request/response body and explains essential information such as authentication and error handling.

An API doc may also have a concepts section that explains the use of Objects, or specific API protocols that might pertain to the service or the design in which it is built in your company.
