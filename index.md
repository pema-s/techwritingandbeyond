**Hi there!** 

This is a space I maintain for recording insights, learnings and personal notes taken in the course of my work as a Technical Writer. Feel free to look around, send me note if you like and let me know if you'd like to see something on this space.

Hope you find something useful here! :) 

## Topics to explore

When you visit my site, you will find a variety of topics (because I usually jot down everything I find worth recording irrespective of what they relate to). Even then, you can find a certain structure here such as everything to do with Developer documentation like (API documentation) is under **Developer Docs**. Any release related topics can be found under **Release Notes Writing** although this category does not only touch upon release notes information. 

While you are here, take a look at the **Presentations** on the top nav that has links to slide decks I've created while I spoke at various tech writing meets such as Write The Docs (WTD).

The **Dev Experience** section is dedicated for interesting research, findings and may not exactly relate to writing but defintetly worthy keeping a tab of if you're into the developer documentation space.

## Connect with me

I'd like to hear your thoughts on all the topics I share here. You can comment on the posts or connect with me on LinkedIn. I'm always curious to know about other Tech Writer's experiences and learnings.
